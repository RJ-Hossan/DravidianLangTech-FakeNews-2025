# **Fake News Detection - Social Media Analysis @ NAACL 2025**  

This repository contains our implementation for the **Fake News Detection Shared Task**, organized as part of **Social Media Analysis @ NAACL 2025**. The goal of this task is to classify social media posts as **Original** or **Fake**, leveraging NLP techniques to combat misinformation.  

## **Task Overview**  

With the rapid rise of social media, false or misleading information—commonly referred to as **fake news**—has become a growing concern. This shared task challenges participants to build robust machine learning models that can **detect and classify fake news** based on textual content from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.  

### **Subtasks**  

- **Task 1**: Classify a given social media post as **Original** or **Fake** based on its textual content.  
- **Task 2**: Given a YouTube comment, determine whether it contains **original** or **fake** news.  

### **Key Details**  

- **Data Sources**: Social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube)  
- **Evaluation Metric**: Macro F1 Score  
- **Dataset**: Contains labeled text samples for training and evaluation  
- **Objective**: Develop a system that accurately classifies posts/comments as:  
  - **Fake News**  
  - **Original News**
